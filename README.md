# Data Structures Final Project

## Project Summary

This project, when implemented, will be a command line C++ application that builds the user a virtual library from his or her collection of books. Books may be input either using the ISBN, which will query Google Books using its API and interpret the JSON-formatted output, or manually. Book information will be stored using a red-black tree. The user will have the ability to retrieve and store library information from a local file formatted using JSON.

Future development opportunities include the ability to edit book information and delete books, query multiple books from a CSV file, and store personal ratings and reviews for a book.

## How to Run

The program may be launched from the Linux command line by navigating to the directory and typing "./Library" to execute the file. The user is presented with a startup menu:

=====VIRTUAL LIBRARY=====

1. Create a new library
2. Open an existing library
3. Exit

After one of the first two options is selected, the user is prompted for a filename and the library is either created or opened. The main menu is then presented:

========MAIN MENU========

1. Add a book from ISBN
2. Add a book manually
3. Print information for a single book
4. Print information for the entire library
4. Save library to file
5. Exit

Further documentation, including expected inputs and outputs and their data types for each menu option, may be accessed in the repository file "METHOD_DOCUMENTATION.md".
